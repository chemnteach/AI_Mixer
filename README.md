### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd AI_Mixer
```

2. **Create virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Linux/Mac)
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install Python packages:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
```bash
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env and add your API keys:
# - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# - OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### Usage

**Fully Automated Workflow (Recommended):**
```bash
# One-step mashup creation with auto-matching
python -m mixer auto path/to/song.mp3

# Interactive mode with guided prompts
python -m mixer interactive
```

**Manual Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Ingest audio files or YouTube URLs
python -m mixer ingest https://youtube.com/watch?v=...
python -m mixer ingest path/to/song.mp3

# 2. Analyze songs (extracts BPM, key, lyrics, mood, sections)
python -m mixer analyze <song-id>
python -m mixer analyze --batch  # Analyze all unanalyzed songs

# 3. Find compatible matches
python -m mixer match <song-id> --criteria hybrid --top 5

# 4. Create mashup
python -m mixer mashup <song-a> <song-b> --type classic
python -m mixer mashup <song-a> <song-b> --type conversational
```

**Library Management:**
```bash
# List all songs
python -m mixer library list

# Search library
python -m mixer library search "upbeat country"

# Show statistics
python -m mixer library stats
```

**Available Mashup Types:**
- `classic` - Vocal from A + instrumental from B
- `stem-swap` - Swap specific instruments between songs
- `energy` - Match energy levels across sections
- `adaptive` - Dynamic mixing based on energy curves
- `theme` - Align songs by lyrical themes
- `semantic` - Match emotional arcs
- `role-aware` - Q&A vocal dynamics
- `conversational` - Dialogue-style vocal flow

**Help:**
```bash
python -m mixer --help
python -m mixer mashup --help  # Command-specific help
```

### Testing the Memory System

**Run the interactive demo:**
```bash
python scripts/test_memory_demo.py
```

This demo script:
- Initializes ChromaDB with sample songs
- Demonstrates harmonic matching (BPM + key)
- Shows semantic matching (mood + vibe)
- Tests hybrid matching (recommended)
- Displays collection statistics

**Run unit tests:**
```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_memory.py -v
```
