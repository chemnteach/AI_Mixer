goal: Integrate Crossfade Club video generation tab into Streamlit UI
now: Test UI, enable controls when Blender assets are ready
test: streamlit run mixer_ui.py

done_this_session:
  - task: Added "Generate Video" tab to mixer_ui.py with grayed-out controls
    files: [mixer_ui.py]
  - task: Created generate_video_tab() function with full UI workflow (disabled)
    files: [mixer_ui.py]
  - task: Updated sidebar About section to mention video generation
    files: [mixer_ui.py]

blockers: []

questions:
  - When will Blender animation assets (.blend files) be available?
  - Should we add asset upload functionality to the UI for users to add their own .blend files?

decisions:
  - ui_integration: Added as 4th tab (between Library and Settings) for unified experience
  - disabled_state: All controls grayed out with warning banner explaining why (assets required)
  - progressive_disclosure: Used expanders for Technical Details and Asset Requirements to avoid overwhelming users
  - asset_location: Clearly documented that assets go in studio/assets/ directory

findings:
  - Existing Streamlit UI has excellent structure for adding new tabs
  - mixer_ui.py is 1066 lines (was 895 lines) - still manageable
  - User has 4 projects and was mixing them up - unified UI helps prevent confusion
  - Disabling controls is better than hiding the tab entirely - sets user expectations

worked:
  - Using disabled=True on all form controls creates consistent grayed-out appearance
  - Warning banner at top of tab clearly communicates feature status
  - Expanders keep advanced info accessible without cluttering main interface
  - 5-step workflow structure matches natural user flow (select → configure → generate)

failed: []

next:
  - Test the UI by running `streamlit run mixer_ui.py` and verifying the Generate Video tab displays correctly
  - When Blender assets are ready, change all disabled=True to disabled=False in generate_video_tab()
  - Wire up "Generate Videos" button to call BatchRunner from batch.runner module
  - Add progress indicators for video generation (timeline → render → encode stages)
  - Consider adding asset upload interface for users to add their own .blend files
  - Add video preview player for generated outputs

    - mixer_ui.py  # Added generate_video_tab() function (171 lines), updated tabs structure, updated sidebar
