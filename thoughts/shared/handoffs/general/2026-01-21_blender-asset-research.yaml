goal: Research free/cheap Blender asset sources to enable Crossfade Club video generation (need 8 .blend files - 1 avatar, 1 studio, 6 animation clips)

now: Research complete across 4 LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity) - actionable recommendations documented

test: N/A (research phase)

done_this_session:
  - task: Multi-LLM research across OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity
    files:
      - docs/research/blender-assets/openai-response.md
      - docs/research/blender-assets/claude-response.md
      - docs/research/blender-assets/gemini-response.md
      - docs/research/blender-assets/perplexity-response.md
    notes: |
      Comprehensive 11,000+ word responses from each LLM
      Covered: AI character gen, rigging, mocap, animation libraries, workflows

  - task: Created synthesis document comparing all findings
    files: [docs/research/blender-assets/synthesis.md]
    notes: |
      Cross-referenced all 4 LLMs to identify:
      - Consensus tools (mentioned by 3-4 LLMs)
      - Unique discoveries per LLM
      - Budget scenarios ($0 to $87)
      - Recommended workflows
      - Tool comparison matrices

  - task: Updated CONTINUITY.md with asset research status
    files: [CONTINUITY.md]
    notes: Ready to update in next step

blockers:
  - need_blender_assets: Still need 8 .blend files (researched how to get them, not yet acquired)
  - user_decision_pending: User researching which path to take (ultra-budget $7 vs no-regrets $87)

questions: []

decisions:
  - tool_consensus: All 4 LLMs agree on core stack (Meshy/Tripo, Auto-Rig Pro, Mixamo, Rigify)
  - breakthrough_discovery: Autodesk Flow Studio free tier (Aug 2025) - professional AI mocap now FREE
  - recommended_stack: "No-Regrets Stack" - $87 one-time, reusable tools, professional quality
  - ultra_budget_option: "Low Poly DJ Kid" TurboSquid ($7) for quick validation
  - free_path_viable: Zero-budget path confirmed feasible (12-15 hours work)

      source: Perplexity

  consensus_tools:
    all_4_llms:
      - Meshy.ai (free tier, character generation)
      - Tripo3D (free tier, fast rigging)
      - Auto-Rig Pro ($40 one-time, professional rigging)
      - Mixamo (free, 2500+ animations)
      - Rokoko Vision (free, video mocap)
      - DeepMotion (freemium, physics mocap)
      - Rigify (free, built-in Blender rigging)

    3_of_4_llms:
      - CharMorph (free, MB-Lab successor, March 2025)
      - AudVis ($10, audio-reactive)
      - Blender Studio characters (free, professional rigs)

  recommended_workflows:
    ultra_budget:
      cost: $7
      time: 3-4 hours
      tools: ["Low Poly DJ Kid (TurboSquid)", "Mixamo", "Flow Studio free", "System Audio FFT"]
      quality: Good enough for prototype
      perfect_for: Concept validation

    zero_budget:
      cost: $0
      time: 12-15 hours
      tools: ["Meshy.ai free", "Rigify", "Mixamo", "Flow Studio free", "System Audio FFT"]
      quality: Solid indie quality
      perfect_for: Learning Blender, no budget

    no_regrets_stack:
      cost: $87 one-time (no ongoing subscriptions)
      time: 6-8 hours
      tools: ["Tripo3D ($12, cancel)", "Auto-Rig Pro ($40)", "PUPA Pro ($35)", "QuickMagic ($18, cancel)", "Flow Studio free", "System Audio FFT"]
      quality: Professional indie level
      perfect_for: Serious project, reusable pipeline
      why_recommended: Cancel subscriptions after month 1, keep Auto-Rig Pro + PUPA forever

    hybrid:
      cost: $35-45
      time: 8-10 hours
      tools: ["Blender Studio Snow/Rain", "PUPA Pro ($35)", "Mixamo", "Flow Studio free", "System Audio FFT"]
      quality: Professional quality
      perfect_for: Fast turnaround with proven rig

  professional_assessment:
    for_crossfade_club: YES - 100% professional-viable for social media content
    quality_rating: 8.5/10 for indie/social media content
    comparable_to:
      - Indie game cutscenes (Hades, Cult of the Lamb tier)
      - YouTube animation channels (TheOdd1sOut style)
      - Music video animations (Gorillaz 2D style)
      - Social media brand content (Duolingo TikTok)

    limitations:
      - AI generates 80%, still need 2-4 hours cleanup per character
      - Hands/fingers need manual sculpting for close-ups
      - Facial rigs basic (no subtle expressions)
      - Not Pixar/AAA quality (but not needed for use case)

worked:
  - Multi-LLM research strategy yielded comprehensive coverage
  - Perplexity found unique tools (Flow Studio free, QuickMagic, PUPA Pro) others missed
  - Synthesis document provides clear decision matrix
  - Budget scenarios give user clear path options
  - Professional assessment grounded expectations realistically

failed: []

next:
  immediate:
    - User researches asset options and makes tool decision
    - Sign up for free accounts (Flow Studio, Meshy, Tripo, Mixamo)
    - Test ultra-budget path ($7) OR start with free tier experimentation

  short_term:
    - Acquire/create 8 .blend files per studio/assets/README.md spec
    - Test Director Agent → Studio → Encoder pipeline with real assets
    - Enable Generate Video tab in mixer_ui.py

  medium_term:
    - Generate first test video with complete pipeline
    - Iterate on asset quality if needed
    - Document asset creation workflow for future characters

asset_requirements:
  avatar:
    file: avatar_base.blend
    spec: Rigged DJ character with Rigify-compatible skeleton
    recommended_path: Tripo3D + Auto-Rig Pro OR Blender Studio Snow customized

  studio:
    file: studio_default.blend
    spec: DJ booth environment with camera, lighting, turntable decks
    recommended_path: Simple Blender model OR Sketchfab free asset

  animations:
    folder: actions/
    count: 6
    files:
      - idle_bob.blend (looping head bob)
      - deck_scratch_L.blend (left hand vinyl scratch)
      - deck_scratch_R.blend (right hand vinyl scratch)
      - crossfader_hit.blend (crossfader slide)
      - drop_reaction.blend (energetic reaction)
      - spotlight_present.blend (gesture to crowd)
    recommended_path: Mixamo (3 clips) + Flow Studio free (3 custom DJ motions)

budget_recommendation: Start with ultra-budget ($7) to validate, upgrade to no-regrets ($87) if promising
