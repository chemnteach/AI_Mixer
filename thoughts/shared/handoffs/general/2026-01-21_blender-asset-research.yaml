goal: Research free/cheap Blender assets to enable Crossfade Club video generation
now: User executing multi-LLM research prompt, will resume with findings
test: N/A (research phase)

done_this_session:
  - task: Reviewed ledger and all recent handoff documents
    files: [CONTINUITY.md, thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/*.yaml]
  - task: Identified Blender asset requirements from studio/assets/README.md
    files: [studio/assets/README.md]
  - task: Discussed Rigify vs pre-baked animation tradeoffs
    notes: |
      - Rigify enables procedural animation via Python
      - But procedural animation looks robotic/mechanical
      - Pre-baked clips have organic feel (anticipation, follow-through, ease)
      - Conclusion: Quality matters, keep pre-baked design
  - task: Discussed asset sourcing options
    notes: |
      - Custom freelancer: $500-2200 (too expensive for hobby experiment)
      - DIY with free tools: $0 (preferred path)
      - Decision: This is a hobby, not a money maker yet
  - task: Created multi-LLM research prompt for asset discovery
    notes: Prompt sent to Claude.ai, ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity
  - task: Fixed CONTINUITY.md ledger inconsistencies
    files: [CONTINUITY.md]
    notes: |
      - Removed outdated "Known Issues" that claimed phases 4-7 incomplete
      - Updated Crossfade Club section to reflect implementation complete
      - Updated handoff document list
      - Updated test coverage summary (237+ tests total)
      - Updated "Next Session Priorities" to reflect asset research

blockers:
  - Need Blender assets (8 .blend files) to enable video generation
  - Waiting for multi-LLM research results

questions:
  - What AI tools exist for 3D character generation in 2024-2025?
  - Are there Blender addons that simplify character creation?
  - Can AI motion capture convert video to animation data?
  - What pre-made character libraries exist beyond Mixamo?

decisions:
  - freelancer_cost: Too expensive for hobby experiment ($500-2200)
  - diy_approach: Preferred - use free tools (Mixamo, BlendSwap, AI generators)
  - quality_vs_cost: Accept "good enough" quality for MVP, polish later if successful
  - procedural_vs_baked: Keep pre-baked animation design for quality
  - multi_llm_research: Use Claude/GPT/Gemini/Perplexity to discover tools

findings:
  - Rigify is built into Blender with standardized bone names
  - Procedural animation saves assets but looks robotic
  - Pre-baked clips are important for organic "alive" feeling
  - Fiverr artists use same tools (Blender, Rigify) user could use themselves
  - Mixamo has 2500+ free animations including DJ-specific motions
  - Hybrid approach possible: 2-3 key clips + procedural modulation

worked:
  - Reviewing recent handoffs gave complete picture of project state
  - Identifying ledger inconsistencies improved documentation accuracy
  - Breaking down asset requirements clarified scope (8 files, specific specs)
  - Cost analysis helped user decide on DIY approach

failed: []

next:
  - Execute multi-LLM research prompt across Claude.ai, ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity
  - Compare research results to find best free/cheap asset sources
  - Evaluate AI character generation tools (Meshy, Tripo3D, etc.)
  - Attempt DIY asset creation using discovered tools
  - If successful, enable Generate Video tab in mixer_ui.py

  **Research Task: Blender Character Creation Tools & Workflows (2024-2025)**

  I'm looking for tools, addons, AI services, or workflows that make creating
  rigged, animated 3D characters for Blender easier or faster. The end goal is
  a stylized cartoon DJ character with 5-6 short animations for an automated
  video pipeline.

  Categories to research:
  1. AI-Powered 3D Character Generation
  2. Blender Character Creation Addons
  3. AI Motion Capture / Video-to-Animation
  4. Procedural Animation Tools
  5. Pre-Made Character Libraries
  6. Recent Breakthroughs (2024-2025)

  For each tool, provide: Name, URL, Cost, What it does, Output format,
  Quality level, Limitations.

  Constraints: Blender 3.6+, prefer free or under $50, stylized/cartoon style,
  need rigged character + 5-6 short animation clips.

asset_requirements:
  core_files:
    - avatar_base.blend: DJ character with Rigify rig
    - studio_default.blend: DJ booth with camera, lighting, decks
  action_clips:
    - idle_bob.blend: 2s looping head bob
    - deck_scratch_L.blend: 0.8s left hand scratch
    - deck_scratch_R.blend: 0.8s right hand scratch
    - crossfader_hit.blend: 1s crossfader slide
    - drop_reaction.blend: 1.5s energetic reaction
    - spotlight_present.blend: 2s gesture to audience
