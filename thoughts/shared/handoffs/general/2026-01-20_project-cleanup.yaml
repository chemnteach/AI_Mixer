goal: Clean up project directory after Crossfade Club implementation
now: Project is clean, organized, and fully committed to git
test: git status

done_this_session:
  - task: Deleted stray nul file (Windows command artifact)
    files: [nul (deleted)]
  - task: Cleaned all Python cache files (__pycache__, *.pyc, .pytest_cache)
    files: [cache directories (deleted)]
  - task: Created docs/ directory structure and reorganized documentation
    files: [docs/crossfade-club/, docs/archive/]
  - task: Moved Crossfade Club documentation to docs/crossfade-club/
    files: [CROSSFADE_CLUB_PRD.md, CROSSFADE_CLUB_COMPLETE.md]
  - task: Archived IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md to docs/archive/
    files: [IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md]
  - task: Committed all Crossfade Club implementation (58 files, 7,612 insertions)
    files: [all modules, tests, scripts, docs]
  - task: Committed documentation reorganization
    files: [docs/ structure]

blockers: []

questions: []

decisions:
  - cache_cleanup: Remove all __pycache__ and .pyc files (regenerate automatically)
  - doc_organization: Create docs/ directory with crossfade-club/ and archive/ subdirectories
  - progress_archival: Keep IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md in archive/ for historical reference
  - commit_strategy: Two commits - implementation first, then doc reorganization

findings:
  - Project was clean overall - no large temp files or unused artifacts
  - Output directories (outputs/timeline, outputs/renders, etc.) were empty as expected
  - Test cache directories were also empty
  - Only cleanup needed was Python cache and doc organization
  - Git warnings about LF→CRLF are normal for Windows development

worked:
  - Sequential cleanup approach (delete → organize → commit) prevented issues
  - Two-commit strategy keeps history clean (implementation vs reorganization)
  - docs/ directory structure scales well for future expansions
  - Archive directory preserves historical documents without cluttering root

failed: []

next:
  - Test Streamlit UI: streamlit run mixer_ui.py
  - When Blender assets ready, enable Generate Video tab controls
  - Consider adding .gitattributes to handle line endings consistently
  - Future: Add docs/mixer/ for Mixer-specific documentation
