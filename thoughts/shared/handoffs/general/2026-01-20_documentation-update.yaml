goal: Comprehensive documentation update for Crossfade Club implementation
now: All documentation reflects current state (Mixer + Crossfade Club complete)
test: git log --oneline -5

done_this_session:
  - task: Created comprehensive SETUP.md for new machine deployment
    files: [SETUP.md]
  - task: Updated README.md with complete Crossfade Club documentation
    files: [README.md]
  - task: Updated CLAUDE.md to reflect implementation complete (not future)
    files: [CLAUDE.md]
  - task: Committed all documentation updates with proper attribution
    files: [all documentation files]

blockers: []

questions: []

decisions:
  - setup_guide: Created dedicated SETUP.md instead of embedding in README (separation of concerns)
  - readme_structure: Reorganized as "Mixer + Crossfade Club" with clear sections for each
  - status_updates: Changed CLAUDE.md from "Future Expansion" to "Implementation Complete"
  - doc_references: Updated all file paths to reflect new docs/ directory structure

findings:
  - README was completely missing Crossfade Club (366 lines old → 492 lines new)
  - CLAUDE.md still said "Design phase - PRD complete, implementation not yet started" (outdated)
  - Documentation references pointed to old file locations (before docs/ reorganization)
  - mixer_ui.py line count outdated (600 → 1066 lines)
  - All core documentation now accurately reflects project state

worked:
  - Separate sections for Mixer (audio) vs Crossfade Club (video) improve clarity
  - Tables for mashup types and platform formats make information scannable
  - Prerequisites clearly distinguish required vs optional dependencies
  - SETUP.md provides complete deployment checklist
  - Updated roadmap shows what's complete vs future enhancements

failed: []

next:
  - Consider adding visual diagrams to documentation (architecture flowcharts)
  - Add troubleshooting section to SETUP.md based on user feedback
  - Create video tutorial once Blender assets are ready
  - Consider adding CONTRIBUTING.md for open source contributors

files:
  created:
    - SETUP.md (343 lines - comprehensive setup guide)
    - thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2026-01-20_documentation-update.yaml
  modified:
    - README.md (366→492 lines - added Crossfade Club, updated all sections)
    - CLAUDE.md (updated status, implementation details, doc references)
  deleted: []
