session: 13
date: 2026-01-27
duration: ~30 minutes
project: AI_Mixer / Crossfade Club

goal: |
  Import downloaded Sketchfab DJ character into Blender and save as avatar_base.blend
  (first of 8 required Blender assets for Crossfade Club video pipeline)

done_this_session:
  - Verified character files already extracted at studio/assets/source/Black Character Rigged UE4/
  - Opened Blender 5.0.1
  - Imported Black Boy Cartoon Lowpoly.fbx via File > Import > FBX
  - Tested rig in Pose Mode - bones correctly deform mesh
  - Saved as avatar_base.blend (initially saved to wrong location due to path parsing)
  - Moved file to correct location: studio/assets/avatar_base.blend (1.3 MB)
  - Updated CONTINUITY.md ledger with progress

blockers: []

decisions:
  - title: Stay on current machine for development
    choice: Continue on Windows VM (24GB RAM) rather than migrate to home box (256GB)
    rationale: |
      Current work is lightweight (Blender setup, file management).
      Heavy compute (video rendering, Demucs) comes later.
      Migration adds friction; wait until pipeline is proven end-to-end.

findings:
  - Blender 5.0.1 path parsing quirk - typing full Windows path in save dialog creates filename with underscores
  - FBX import worked smoothly with Auto-Rig Pro rigged character
  - Rig is functional - bones move, mesh follows correctly

worked:
  - FBX import from Sketchfab download
  - Rig testing in Pose Mode
  - Moving misplaced file via bash

failed: []

assets_complete:
  - name: avatar_base.blend
    path: studio/assets/avatar_base.blend
    size: 1.3 MB
    status: complete
    notes: DJ character with working rig, textures embedded

assets_remaining:
  - name: studio_default.blend
    description: DJ booth environment
    source: Sketchfab/BlendSwap or manual modeling
  - name: idle_bob.blend
    description: Idle animation with weight shift
    source: Mixamo
  - name: deck_scratch_L.blend
    description: Left turntable scratch motion
    source: Mixamo or custom
  - name: deck_scratch_R.blend
    description: Right turntable scratch motion

  - name: spotlight_present.blend
    description: Pointing/greeting motion
    source: Mixamo

next:
  - priority: high
    task: Download 5-6 animations from Mixamo (free Adobe account)
    notes: Quickest path to more assets - just download FBX files
  - priority: medium
    task: Find or create DJ booth environment (studio_default.blend)
    notes: Search Sketchfab for free "DJ booth" or model simple version
  - priority: low
    task: Consider migration to home box (256GB RAM, 4GB VRAM)
    notes: Wait until pipeline is proven; CPU rendering is fine for this project

hardware_notes:
  current_machine: Windows VM, 24GB RAM (upgrading to 36GB soon)
  home_box: 256GB RAM, 4GB VRAM - good for batch processing later
  recommendation: Stay on current machine for development, migrate for production
