    notes: |
      "Black Lowpoly Character Rigged for UE4" by MotionStudioArts
      - Pre-rigged with Auto-Rig Pro (same tool recommended in research)
      - Low poly, good for rendering performance
      - FBX format (imports into Blender)

blockers:
  - server_maintenance: Session interrupted for server maintenance
  - avatar_not_saved: FBX downloaded but not yet imported/saved as .blend

questions: []

decisions:
  - ultra_budget_path: Chose $0 path instead of $7 (found free Sketchfab alternative)
  - sketchfab_over_turbosquid: Free rigged DJ character vs $7 purchase

worked:
  - Web search found free DJ character that matches requirements
  - Sketchfab model already rigged with Auto-Rig Pro (quality rig)
  - Extraction to project folder successful
  - Blender installation straightforward

failed: []

next:
  immediate:
    - step: Import FBX into Blender
      command: File → Import → FBX → select "Black Boy Cartoon Lowpoly.fbx"

    - step: Test rig works
      command: Select character → Pose Mode → rotate arm bone

    - step: Save as avatar_base.blend
      path: C:\Users\cdbrown\Git\AI_Mixer\studio\assets\avatar_base.blend

  short_term:
    - Find/create studio_default.blend (DJ booth environment)
    - Get 6 animation clips from Mixamo (free)
    - Test Director Agent → Studio → Encoder pipeline

  animations_needed:
    - idle_bob.blend (looping head bob)
    - deck_scratch_L.blend (left hand vinyl scratch)
    - deck_scratch_R.blend (right hand vinyl scratch)
    - crossfader_hit.blend (crossfader slide)
    - drop_reaction.blend (energetic reaction)
